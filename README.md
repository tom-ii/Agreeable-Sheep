This is a 3D-Printable "Agreeable sheep"

My son is making one as a group project in his 8th grade TechEd class. I thought it might be fun to model one up and print it out. Sizes were all figured by eyeball, and trying to be aesthetic.

There's a slight problem with it, in that turning the crank clockwise will cause it to jam, but turning it counterclockwise works fine.

I understand what the problem is, but I don't see me doing anything to fix it.

After printing, I needed to use a #60 drill bit to clean out the connector holes for the connecting pins.

For the pins, I used short cut-off lengths from the legs from some electronic components (20 mil diameter)
